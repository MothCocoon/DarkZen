The primary goal is to avoid Christmas tree clusterfuck in C/C++ syntax highlighting
- make entire text less saturted
- group similar elements together by color

Here's the list of major colors changed that diers from One Dark Pro theme, a base for my theme.
List if essential since VS Color Editor doesn't use anything similar to CSS stylesheets.
There are thousands of fields to update separately. And Color Editor crashes often if you click too fast... or using Search many times...
