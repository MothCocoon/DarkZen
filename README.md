## Dark Zen theme
* Toned-down syntax highlighting for C++. Makes easy to analyze the code, quickly find method calls and class variables.
* Includes styling for Resharper C++ and Unreal Engine elements.
* I was using this scheme with VS 2017 and 2019. Hovewer, work on Visual Studio is abandoned.
* Currently I'm using this scheme under Rider for Unreal Engine preview.
