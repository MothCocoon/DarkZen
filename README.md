Collection of Visual Studio utilities

## Dark Zen theme
* Based on [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme) theme. Kept blue vibe, but entirely revamped syntax highlighting for C++. It was more like Christmas tree and I wanted to have toned-down colors, grouping similar things together by color. Make easy to analyze the code, quickly find method calls and class variables.
* Includes styling for Resharper C++ and Unreal Engine 4 elements.
* Still work in progress, tested with VS 2017
